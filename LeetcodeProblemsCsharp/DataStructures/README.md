- Sets & HashMaps / Dictionaries
- Heaps

- Stacks

### Linked lists

A LinkedList is a linear data structure which stores element in the non-contiguous location. 
The elements in a linked list are linked with each other using pointers.
Or in other words, LinkedList consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list
