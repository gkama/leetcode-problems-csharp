Algorithms

## Big O notation

Used to analyze the cost of an algorithm. Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. 
In plain words, Big O notation describes the complexity of your code using algebraic terms.
